Correlational research design is used for the study. The population the study consist of 300 firm-year observation .The data for this study were sourced from the annual accounts and reports of the companies within the period of the study.

But, the ratio of long-term debt to total assets, total debt to total assets and total debt to total equity have positive effect on firm value. While board size and firm growth have no significant effect on firm value, firm size was found to have negative effect on firm value.
