To further contribute to the discussion, the main objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of organizational learning on SME performance with competitive strategy as the mediating effect.

The results revealed that there are significant impact of organizational learning and competitive strategy on SME performance. Also, the competitive strategy has a significant mediating effect on organizational learning and SME performance in Brunei Darussalam. The conclusion of the findings suggests the organizational learning activities should compliment with the requirement of competitive strategy.
