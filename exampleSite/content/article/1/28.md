abstract = "The purpose of this paper is to identify the underlying factors influencing the career choice of university students in Brunei. Specifically, the students that are being sampled are those currently undertaking Bachelorâ€™s Degree courses at Universiti Brunei Darussalam. Career choice is proven to be a phenomenon among individuals, notably for students who are about to finish their studies where they have to make arguably one of the most important decisions in their lives on where to work in order to make a living. However, the underlying factors as to what motivates them to pursue their desired career path needs to be assessed. By using the Three-Dimensional Framework, this paper attempts to undertake a descriptive analysis on the factors influencing career choice of university students, by collecting a data sample of 306 students from six faculties in Universiti Brunei Darussalam. Based on a Likert scale of 1 to 5, it has been found that intrinsic factors are the strongest factor influencing career choice, with an average score of 3.71, while interpersonal factors hold the lowest average score of 2.85. It can be concluded that university students are motivated by intrinsic factors when making decisions on their career choice. It is also found that Pure Science students place emphasis on their skills, abilities and work experiences in determining career choice while the answers provided by Social Sciences students are more varied."
