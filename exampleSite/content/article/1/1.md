abstract = "This paper reports the outcome of an empirical study on the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Nigeria. SMEs are the backbone of developing economies but the sector is found to be underperforming in Nigeria due to poor management and inadequate funding which results in the increase of unemployment and slow economic growth. The study employed a survey research design using balanced panel data. The data was obtained from a sample of 55 Nigerian SMEs in Katsina State for the period 2012 - 2016. The outcome of the study revealed significant positive association between CEO tenure and family ownership with SMEs’ performance and significant negative association between CEO duality and women on board with SMEs’ performance. This indicates that family-owned SMEs and SMEs with longer-tenure CEOs are associated with increase in firm performance, whereas SMEs with CEO duality and women directors are associated with decrease in firm performance. The findings suggest that SMEs’ owners should infuse a good corporate governance structure for increased performance. The study contributes to the body of knowledge theoretically by providing a factual effect of corporate governance on SMEs’ performance and adds to the existing literature on the relationship between corporate governance and SMEs’ performance. Practically, the study will benefit SMEs’ owners/managers, government, management consultants, and financial institutions in policies and decision making relating to governance of SMEs. However, the study is limited to a few corporate governance mechanisms and a small sample of Nigerian SMEs for aperiod of five years."
