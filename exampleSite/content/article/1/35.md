abstract = "Service Level Agreement (SLA) is an important contract between service provider and service recipient where services are expected to be delivered and received accordingly. SLA should include all information regarding the services provided along with their expected performance measures. Usually, the common parameter to define the quality of service (QoS) of these services are defined the time delivery, response time, execution time, service availability, access time, throughput, network bandwidth, service latency, or server uptime or down- time. Cumulatively at the end of the service chain, SLA should able to tell the services' performance, quality, faults and other non-compliance. If the quality of service does not meet the SLA agreement terms, certain level of penalties can legally be imposed. Normally the SLA violation occurred due to technical problem with either the software or the hardware. Despite the technical quality measures, human factors and its attributes are also important to achieve quality in providing services and to comply with SLA. This paper describes the significance and meaningfulness of relationships between negated human factors, namely, user resistance, lack of skill/knowledge, reluctant to share information and shortage of IT staff, with the SLA compliance. It also described in this paper how the relationship model should be used to in- crease SLA compliance as agreed in public hospitals."
