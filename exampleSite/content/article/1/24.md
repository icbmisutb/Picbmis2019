abstract = "Intellectual Property (IP) acquisition by local universities in Malaysia has become even more important after the gazette of the Malaysian Intellectual Property Corporation Act, 2002 (Act 617) enactment, however, but its commercial success rate is yet to be commended. Despite the huge government investments in the R&D sector, return-on-investment is still vague. Focusing to improve the IP acquisition system employed by universities in Malaysia and to serve as a reference model of an IP exploitation framework, the study will (1) assess the barriers or challenges held with-in the process; (2) suggest suitable IP exploitation enablers or strategic initiatives; and (3) recommend improvements to the existing system through a holistic IP exploitation framework. To achieve this goal two-layer of Delphi semi-structured interviews were conducted with experienced Researchers and managers from five prominent Research Universities (RUs) in Malaysia who were competent in the process of IP acquisition and exploitation, together with industrial funders and collaborators who have vast experience in the full cycle of IP commercialization process with the five RUs. This study does not subject to transform any existing IP policies that have been established, albeit may cause future transformation, but will take into account weaknesses that caused the incompetence. In conclusion the study found that there are six important elements that need to be highlighted towards strengthening the universities IP exploitation and commercialization, which are the establishment of IP pol-icy, the efficiency of IP management process, the competency of IP managers, the acumen of IP commercialization, the attractiveness of IP incentives, and finally the continuous IP funding support."
