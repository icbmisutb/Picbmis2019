abstract = "The emergence phase in entrepreneurship found to be crucial for most nascent venture. Determinants of nascent venture performance represent a central topic in the entrepreneurship literature. Nascent venture performance is the ability of an emerging business to operate profitably within three to five years of its establishment. Due to newness of the venture, the failure and discontinued rate among Malaysian nascent venture is high. Addressing associations among entrepreneurial strategies, resources acquisition, and nascent venture performance, the objective of this study is to examine entrepreneurial bricolage (EB), entrepreneurial orientation (EO), online social networking and government assistance programs affect nascent venture performance. This study employs a quantitative approach of research and survey method was used to conduct study on 165 Malay-owned nascent venture in Malaysia and the data were analyzed using SmartPLS. The findings show that entrepreneurial bricolage, EO (proactiveness) and government assistance programs are positively and directly associated with nascent venture performance. This finding implies that nascent ventures in Malaysia is riskaverse and laggards in innovation compared with other developed country. On contrary, the finding also reveal that Malaysia nascent ventures were not fully adopted and utilized the social media usage in doing business."
