abstract = "In this paper we examine how concentrated ownership structure affects product and process in-novation in emerging markets. Empirical results indicate that, on average, concentrated owner-ship impedes firm-level innovation in developing economies. Further analysis indicate that the identity of the main shareholder have differential impact on the probability of introducing product or process innovation. Specifically, concentrated ownership has negative impact on the firm’s propensity to innovate only when the main shareholder is the private individual or a family. However, this effect of concentrated ownership on innovation is positive if the largest shareholder is either domestic or a foreign business group."
