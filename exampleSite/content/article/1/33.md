abstract = "The theory behind performance appraisal is good, but in practice, it suffers from imperfect implementation due to managerial errors when carrying out their responsibility. This led to issues commonly observed in the literature such as rating bias, insufficient feedback and unattainable criteria among the employees. In order to reduce these problems, this paper attempts to look at the role of context in term of religion, on how it can act as a positive reinforcement to the PA system. This paper then explored the role of Islamic principles such as al-â€˜Adl and Taqwa upon stages in the PA system. This theoretical paper posits that these Islamic principles which are based from Al-Quran and Al-Hadith can act as ethical guidelines that guide the PA implementation by managers, using the perspectives of Ethical theory, thereby reducing the risk of issues aforementioned. This, in turn, shed the light on the potential influence of Islamic principles towards PA system among Muslim countries."
