abstract = "This study proposes a conceptual framework for determining the effect of consumers’ motivation towards purchase intention on online product in Brunei. Nowadays, purchasing goods via internet is growing rapidly in the whole world and it gives confidence to researchers to explore what factors affect consumer see at the time of purchase goods via online. However, this study argues that the driver of the motivation on consumer is yet to be fully identified due to lack of studies that investigate the specific influence as a separate phenomenon and has not been tested in Brunei yet. Therefore, this study utilizes the Technology Acceptance Model with Theory of Reason Action to develop the understanding of consumers’ motivation and intention to purchase online product. The aim for this study is to explore the consumers’ motivation in Brunei such as privacy, website features or designs, online shopping convenience and advertisement. This is to examine whether they are related to purchase intention on online product. The data will be updated by mix methods, where the expected sample will be in small size with expectations of 150 participants in Brunei in order to test the effect variables. This study provides further insight for future researchers who will benefit to study consumers’ motivation in the e-commerce and may assist business managers’ advance their decision-making quality in developing markets."
