abstract = "Economic growth is a considerable key factor of development of a nationâ€™s economic conditions, often proxied by the GDP growth. The US dilemma in confronting the trade war with China would affect its inflation rate via higher tariff on imported goods into the US. Given this current situation, an evaluation of knowing the nexus between inflation and US economic growth is indeed timely. Hence, this study aims to examine the relationship between inflation rate and the US economic growth. An ARDL model is employed to investigate their relationship using data derived from several sources including the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, World Band Development Indicators (WDI), and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) from the period spanning 1970 to 2017. The results found that, in the long run, inflation has a significantly negative effect on the US economic growth. On the other hand, the results of the short run analysis are estimated using the error correction model indicated that inflation rate has a significant effect on the US economic growth."
