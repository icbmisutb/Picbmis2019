abstract = "Predictive maintenance is considered as cost-efficient and acts as an enabler for businesses to be more competitive. Maintenance of pipelines can be complex and costly especially when it is located underground or subsea. Based on the literature survey, many methods have been developed to predict pipeline conditions. To date, however, none have focused on the economic comparison of the various prediction methods. The paper reviews several common methods of pipeline prediction in order to facilitate future assessment of the economic costs of each method. These include Split System Approach, Artificial Neural Network, Reliability Analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation, Standard Data Structure Approach, Bayesian Network, Fuzzy Logic method and other probabilistic assessments that have produced promising results. The different types of machine algorithms are compared in terms of accuracy. Artificial Neural Network is seen as the most popular choice of methods and produced better accuracy compared to the rest of the machine learning algorithm."
