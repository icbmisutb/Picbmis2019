abstract = "The study examines the impact of board diversity on corporate risk-taking and corporate diversification activities of firms in Malaysia. The data used in the study is consists of 712 firms listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia for a five-years (5) period from 2010 to The results show that the diverse board, with the presence of female directors as board members in firm, has reduced firmsâ€™ corporate risk-taking, especially on earnings volatility and debt obligation risks. The similar influence was also recorded for liquidity risk, however, the relationship was insignificant. These results are consistent with many of previous studies that have supported the argument that the female directors have risk-averse behaviour and this reduces their risk-taking in the context of corporate firms. The risk-intolerance behaviour of female directors was also represented through the negative relationship between board diversity and geographical diversification activities and the positive relationship between board diversity and industrial diversification activities. Female directors in the diverse board prefer business venture activities that are less-risky like industrial diversification activities that are usually conducted domestically. Conversely, geographical diversification activities were not preferred as firms need to expose to the high-risk foreign market environment when they venture their businesses across these locations. Theories such as agency and asymmetric information theory, resources dependence theory and human capital theory are in relation to the evidence found in the study, of which it connects the link between gender of board members and tolerance of risk-taking and preference of types of business activities. This study contributes towards an understanding of types of corporate risk-taking preferred by the female directors in the diverse board of Malaysian firms. Practically, it has also highlighted the diversification activities conducted by the board members, with the presence of female directors."
