Advancements in artificial intelligence, mobile internet, internet of things, cloud computing, nextgeneration wireless networking technologies, virtual reality, augmented reality, block chain, edge computing, machine learning, robotic process automation, 3D Printing and many more holds a great promise of creating potential opportunities and access to knowledge. Emergence and advancement of these technologies is brought by Fourth Industrial Revolution resulting from fusion of physical, digital and biological spheres. These technological innovations may revolutionize production processes and enhance living standards, particularly in Muslim developing countries.

This represents a major problematic issue for future of Muslim societies and governments and calls for well planned preparation without comprising on basic tenants of Islam. Their remains a need for academic and intellectual emphasis on this issue in order to enlighten Muslim masses for better understanding of emerging technological change and Fourth Industrial Revolution in a way for preparing them for a careful adaptation and participation in Fourth Industrial Revolution. This descriptive and conceptual study is an academic and scholarly effort which intends to highlight and analyze issues germinating from interaction of Muslim societies and governments with emerging technological change, Fourth Industrial Revolution and ongoing wave of globalization."
