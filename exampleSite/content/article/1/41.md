abstract = "In this data-driven world, Big Data Intelligence has always been a critical technology in harnessing true values of data. Financial institutions can greatly benefit from its use, but the ethical risks associated to it and indistinct regulatory stance have made some financial institutions to hesitate on its implementation. The research has hypothesized that the adoption level of Big Data Intelligence in an organization, whether public or financial, is linked to the awareness on the concerns relating to its processes, measures taken to address related concerns and knowledge of various areas of focus for relevant regulations. To support the hypothesis, data was collected from various level of management and policymakers for both public as well as financial institutions of Brunei Darussalam through the distribution of survey questionnaires. The analysis has focused on using Cronbach Alpha, Pearson Correlation and Linear Regression techniques. The results showed that the hypothesis was partly correct as the analysis has supported that the knowledge on the concerns relating to processes in Big Data Intelligence and the understanding of key areas of regulatorsâ€™ relevance contribute towards the adoption level of Big Data Intelligence in an organization."
