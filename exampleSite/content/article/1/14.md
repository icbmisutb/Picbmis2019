abstract = "Performance Management (PM) is a trending essential ingredient in human resource management (HRM) which is aimed at transforming the public sector. More than ever before, it is nowadays used to support organizations accomplish their goals and mission. The concept is now widely practiced in developed countries and gradually becoming popular in developing countries. There is substantial evidence of empirical studies that focused attention on the effectiveness of performance management systems (PMS). Moreover, notwithstanding the stability of the system, the absence of feedback has been identified as one of the drawbacks associated with the system. Therefore, this paper reviews extant literature and proposes a theoretical framework at the first instance that will support a study to investigate the impact of feedback and how its absence affects performance management of academic staff of public higher education institutions (HEIs) in Nigeria"
