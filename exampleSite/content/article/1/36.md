abstract = "This chapter analyses existing literature on Islamic fintech (i-fintech) to identify the research gaps and to propose future research direction on this topic. To achieve this objective, the authors used several keywords and synonyms for the literature search in Google Scholar. The keywords used are “Islamic fintech”, “fintech and Islamic banking”, “fintech and blockchain”, and “fintech and crowdfunding”. After a two-stage screening process, total 30 articles are selected. The research conducted for this chapter finds that similar to the i-fintech industry, academic research on i-fintech is also in a nascent stage. The research also finds that the current researchers are mostly qualitative nature. The research identifies a great scope of quantitative/empirical research in this field."
