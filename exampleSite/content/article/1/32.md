abstract = "Youth leadership programs can bring youth towards leadership, by means of equipping them with leadership skills. It is significant for these programs to be effective in order to promote better skills enhancement and knowledge development among youth. This paper examines a case study approach on a youth leadership program in Brunei, particularly the Students Leadership & Development Programme (SLDP) of Universiti Teknologi Brunei, with the objective to assess its effectiveness on the basis of the first two levels of Kirkpatrickâ€™s model, which is the reaction and learning aspects of the program. A quantitative method of approach in the form of questionnaire is used to gather the data and descriptive statistics were performed for data analysis of this study. Also, simple linear regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses of the study and it was found that both the aspects of reaction and learning have significant impact on effectiveness of youth leadership program. The findings of the study also suggested that the program was effective, in such a way that both reaction and learning aspects of the program revealed positive results of evaluation. The outcomes further provide a great value to the stakeholders, particularly the program educators and designers as well as adding contributions towards the literature related to youth leadership program and the measure of its effectiveness in Brunei."
