abstract = "In this paper, we empirically examine whether financial constraints can have an impact on the likelihood of abandoning or suspending an innovation project. Using multi-country data drawn from the World Bankâ€™s Enterprise innovation survey data sets for 9 developing markets, we document that financial constraints significantly increases the likelihood of abandoning innovation projects at the execution stage. These results still carry through after accounting for the endogeneity concerns."
