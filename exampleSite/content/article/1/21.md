abstract = "Going concern is an important assumption that underlies the preparation of financial statements. Based on this assumption, financial statements are prepared to reflect the ability of a company to continue operation in perpetuity. In spite of the importance of oil and gas industry to the growth and development of the Nigerian economy, research on Ownership Structure in Nigeria is skewed to other industries of the Nigerian economy especially financial sector with little emphasis to the oil and gas companies. The study is set out to examine the impact of Ownership Structure on Going Concern Evaluation of listed Oil and Gas companies in Nigeria, over the period 20112017. The research covers Eight (8) out of the twelve (12) listed companies in the industry. The study made use of secondary data generated from Annual Reports and Accounts of the companies and the Nigerian Stock Exchange Fact book. The data were analyzed by means of descriptive statistics, correlation and OLS regression analysis using STATA12 package. The study revealed that Directors ownership of shares and institutional ownership of shares significantly influences Going Concern ability of listed oil and gas companies while Chief Executive Ownership of shares shows an inverse insignificant impact on Going Concern Evaluation. The study concluded that Ownership Structure play an effective role on companies’ ability to remain as going concern. It is therefore, suggested that companies in Nigerian oil and gas industry should encourage directors’ ownership and Institutional Ownership of shares as its motivate and increase ease of contact to resources, thereby improve corporate performance"
