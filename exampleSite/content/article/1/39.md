abstract = "This study investigates the influence of audit committee diversity on the extent of discretionary corporate governance (CG) disclosure. Specifically, we study the influence of audit committee independence, the financial expertise of the audit committee member, and the audit committee size on the extent of discretionary CG disclosure. We are using a quantitative approach and sample of 71 Nigerian listed firms over seven years (2011â€“2017) in conducting a dynamic panel GMM analysis of the effect of audit committee diversity on the extent of discretionary CG disclosure. Our analyses are robust as we adopted a system GMM approach as an advanced and superior estimation to overcome unobserved heterogeneity and possible endogeneity of the explanatory variables. In the overall model, the audit committee is found to be positively and significantly determine discretionary disclosure, whereas audit committee independence has no significant effect on discretionary disclosure, but board size and financial expertise of audit committee members are the other important determinants of discretionary disclosure, respectively. The study provides a clear practical implication for business firms, policymakers, future research, and the entire stakeholders by indicating empirically that corporations with a diversified audit committee are more expected to be diligent and apparent about their financial practices, and thereby providing useful information on voluntary discretionary CG disclosure. This study is among the few that provide empirical evidence using sophisticated dynamic panel model in recent times. Nevertheless, this study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt at explicitly measuring the impact of audit committee diversity and discretionary disclosure in corporate governance studies in the developing economy like Nigeria."
